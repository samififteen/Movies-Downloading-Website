# Movie Download Website

This project will be a website for browsing and downloading movies.

## Project Structure

```
/Movies
|-- /frontend       # React frontend application
|-- /backend        # Node.js/Express backend API
|-- README.md       # This file
```

## Setup Plan

1.  **Create Project Structure**: Set up the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
2.  **Frontend Setup (React)**:
    *   Initialize a new React application using `create-react-app` (or Vite) with TypeScript in the `frontend` directory.
    *   Create basic components for displaying movie lists, details, and download links.
3.  **Backend Setup (Node.js/Express)**:
    *   Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend` directory.
    *   Install Express.js and other necessary dependencies (e.g., for handling file downloads, database interaction if needed).
    *   Set up basic API endpoints for fetching movie data and initiating downloads.
4.  **Styling**: Add CSS or a UI library (like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS) for a modern look and feel.
5.  **Functionality**:
    *   Implement movie listing and search.
    *   Implement movie details page.
    *   Implement download functionality (this will require careful consideration of how movie files are stored and served).

Let's start by creating the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
